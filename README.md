Factory Kata
======

This is the solution to a Kata for practicing the following tasks:

  - Creating a Java 1.6 JAR project via Maven/Eclipse (pom creation)
  - Creating a reusable Factory component 
    - Useful for isolating abstractions and easing testing
  - Doing Specification-based BDD with alternate file naming (pom edits)
  - Generating maven artifacts

You can access slides to help lead the Kata here:
